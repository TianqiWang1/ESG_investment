This repository includes some of my codes created for my master thesis [An In-Depth Analysis of the Impact of ESG Investing on Returns Using Large-Scale News Data](https://ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/mtec/chair-of-entrepreneurial-risks-dam/documents/dissertation/master%20thesis/MasterThesisSfS_ESG_Wang.pdf). This thesis aims to investigate the impact of ESG incidents on stock returns using methods, including event study, Jensenâ€™s alpha method, cross-sectional regressions, and portfolio constructions.
